There are two types of AI
1. AGI:
	AGI stands for Artificial General Intelligence. It’s a hypothetical (imaginary for now) form of AI that doesn't exist yet but is the ultimate goal of many AI researchers.
	It refers to a system that can:
	* Understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks.
	* Think, reason, and make decisions like a human.
	* Adapt to new situations, even those it was not explicitly trained for

	Example (Imaginary):
	A robot with AGI could help your child with homework, drive you to work, fix a leaky pipe, and suggest new business ideas — all without being specifically programmed for each task.	
	(Perceive | Comprehend | Think & Solve)
	Still in research stage. No one has built AGI yet. Current AI is far from reaching that level of understanding or flexibility.
	
2. Narrow AI (Currently in use):
	Narrow AI (also known as Weak AI) is the type of AI we actually use today.
	It is:
	* Task-specific: It can only do what it is trained or programmed to do.
	* Lacks understanding: It doesn’t truly “understand” the task like a human does.
	* Very effective at a single job: But completely useless outside of that area.

	Example: Think of Narrow AI like this:
	Imagine a calculator. It can do math better than most people — but it can’t make a phone call or write a song. Similarly, Narrow AI is great at one thing, but that's all.
	* Google Search uses AI to suggest results.
	* ChatGPT (what you're using now) is a narrow AI — trained to generate human-like text.
	* Face recognition in your phone camera.

| Feature            | AGI                             | Narrow AI                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Intelligence Level | Human-level or beyond           | Below human-level                |
| Scope              | General purpose                 | Task-specific                    |
| Learning           | Can learn and adapt to any task | Learns or works only in one area |
| Examples           | None yet (theoretical)          | Siri, Google Maps, ChatGPT       |
| Flexibility        | Very high                       | Very low                         |
| Status             | Future (under development)      | Present (widely used)            |

Why Does It Matter?
AGI will be a game changer: Once achieved, it could transform every aspect of human life — from education and healthcare to engineering and creativity.

Narrow AI is already changing the world: Most tools we use every day — like recommendation systems, chatbots, voice assistants, or fraud detection — are built using narrow AI.

Machine learning-->Deep Learning-->Generative AI
Machine Learning is a broad field where systems learn from data, Deep Learning is a subset using neural networks for complex tasks, and Generative AI is a further subset that creates new content like text, images.

multi-modal: capabilties of doing all code, image, audio, etc
Gen AI, Examples: 
				1. text based: ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini, Claude
				2. image based: midjourney
...
User experience (UX):
Refers to the overall experience a user has when interacting with a product or service.
