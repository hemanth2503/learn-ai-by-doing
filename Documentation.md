Prompt Engineering is the practice of designing effective inputs (prompts) to get accurate or desired outputs from AI models like ChatGPT or image generators.

Types of Prompting:
        1. Zero-Shot Prompting
            * No examples are given.
            * The model is expected to perform the task based on instructions alone.
        Example:
            "Translate this sentence into French: I am happy."

        2. Few-Shot Prompting
            * A few examples are provided in the prompt to help the model understand the task.
        Example:
            * English: I am happy. â†’ French: Je suis heureux.
            * English: She is tired. â†’ French: Elle est fatiguÃ©e.
            * English: They are late. â†’ French:
        3. One-Shot Prompting
            * Exactly one example is shown to guide the model.
            This is a special case of few-shot prompting

ðŸ§  Why It Matters
Prompt engineering helps control the accuracy, format, and creativity of the AIâ€™s outputâ€”especially important in tasks like summarization, code generation, and conversation design.
